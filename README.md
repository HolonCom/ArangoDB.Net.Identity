# ArangoDb.Net.Identity

An [ArangoDb](https://arangodb.com) Identity library for ArangoDB for .NET Core development. 
This library uses the [ArangoDBNetStandard](https://github.com/Actify-Inc/arangodb-net-standard) library as theArangoDB driver. 

It is forked from [endpointsystems/ArangoDB.Net.Identity](https://github.com/endpointsystems/ArangoDB.Net.Identity)

It has recently been migrated to net7.0. This has not been tested yet!

# NOTE
This library is incomplete and absolutely needs all the help it can get. If you're interested in helping out, please feel free to reach out!
